# JollyGameJam2015

A 1v3 couch game created by Paulo Alves, Ricardo Escobar, Justin Hill, and Matthew Stromberg for the 2015 Jolly Game Jam at The University of Texas at Austin. Three players work together to control a large boss ship while one tries to dodge lasers in a small ship. The large ship must hit the small ship with its mega-laser to destroy it but this requires all three players to work together to charge it.
